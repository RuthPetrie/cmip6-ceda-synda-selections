# cmip6-ceda-synda-selections
This GitHub repository is for CEDA site specific Synda selection files.

It does not include Synda selection files that are needed to fulfil CEDA's WCRP replication commitments. 

It will include selection files for
1. CMIP6 data required for UK researchers to use on JASMIN
2. Specific requested data by the UK research community (see restrictions)
3. Testing of Synda transfers

# Request restrictions
Note not all UK researchers will be able to request data to be replicated fromm international hosts and stored on JASMIN.

If you need access to data not on JASMIN you can 
1. Replicate data to your own institution for analysis
2. Replicate data to your own home or group workspace on JASMIN, however be aware of space limitations due this being a shared resource. 

If you have any questions please email support@ceda.ac.uk
